# Cars prices forecasting

This is a second part of the project Matrix - Transformation from DataWorkshop. This part focuses on building the model for predicting cars' prices.

This part, similarly as the first part, lasts 5 days:

* day1 - environment configuration and downloading the data
* [day2](day2_visualisation.ipynb) - dataset visualisations
* [day3](day3_simple_model.ipynb) - building simple model
* [day4](day4_xgboost.ipynb) - using XGBoost
* [day5](day5_hyperopt.ipynb) - using hyperopt for finding the best model parameters
